 * keyboard scroll (PgUp/PgDn/ctrl+u/d/b/f): the whole selection must track
 * the content, unlike drag-to-scroll where focus stays at the mouse. Any
 * point that hits a clamp bound gets its col reset to the full-width edge —
 * its original content scrolled off-screen and was captured by
 * captureScrolledRows, so the col constraint was already consumed. Keeping
 * it would truncate the NEW content now at that screen row. Clamp col is 0
 * for dRow<0 (scrolling down, top leaves, 'above' semantics) or width-1 for
 * dRow>0 (scrolling up, bottom leaves, 'below' semantics).
 *
 * If both ends overshoot the SAME viewport edge (select text → Home/End/g/G
 * jumps far enough that both are out of view), clear — otherwise both clamp
 * to the same corner cell and a ghost 1-cell highlight lingers, and
 * getSelectedText returns one unrelated char from that corner. Symmetric
 * with shiftSelectionForFollow's top-edge check, but bidirectional: keyboard
 * scroll can jump either way.

 * @param dRow - signed row offset to shift by.

/**
 * Translate the selection for a SCROLLBOX VIEWPORT RESIZE: chrome mounting

 * viewport edges WITHOUT any scroll delta — no followScroll event fires, so
 * the follow path never runs and the endpoints keep pointing at stale screen
 * rows. The visible failure: the anchor strands BELOW the shrunken viewport
 * (exactly onto the pill text row when the pill mounts), pickFollowForSelection
 * then rejects every subsequent follow event (anchor outside the viewport),
 * wheel tracking silently dies, and copy-on-select spans whatever the
 * highlight happens to cover — including the chrome row itself ("↓ 回到底部"
 * leaking into bottom-to-top copies, and the rows that scrolled under the
 * dead highlight never reaching the scrolledOff accumulators).
 *
 * Each SHRINKING edge contributes a band of rows the chrome covered:
 *   - top band [oldTop, newTop-1] (chrome above — sticky prompt header)
 *   - bottom band [newBottom+1, oldBottom] (chrome below — pill/spinner)
 * captureScrolledRows preserves the band's text from the PREVIOUS frame's
 * screen (the caller passes frontFrame.screen — the swap hasn't happened)
 * before this frame's paint overwrites it with chrome cells. Growth edges
 * have no band to capture; the shift below just re-widens the clamp.
 *
 * shiftSelection(dRow=0) then re-derives the endpoints: clamps stragglers
 * into the new bounds (virtual-row tracked, so a later re-widening restores
 * the true position and pops the accumulator), pops captured rows whose
 * debt a re-widening returned to the viewport, and clears when BOTH ends
 * land under the same band (the whole selection is under chrome). Unlike
 * the follow path's shiftAnchor/shiftSelectionForFollow split, this uses
 * shiftSelection for BOTH drag and released states: with dRow=0 a live drag
 * focus stays at the mouse unless the chrome covered it too, and
 * shiftSelection is the only shift that pops debt on re-widening — the
 * follow path never re-widens, a resize does (pill unmount).
 *

/**
 * Rehash the rows under the highlight and latch `stale` when they changed
 * without a coordinated shift this frame.
 *
 * Copy reads whatever text occupies the highlight's screen coordinates at
 * commit time. When the transcript REPLACES those rows in place while the
 * highlight sits still (streaming output overwriting folded rows, a card
 * collapsing under the anchor), the copied text is whatever moved in —
 * visibly wrong text, not mojibake from a width bug. The follow/resize
 * shifts keep the highlight anchored to text that MOVES; this guard catches
 * the complementary case: stationary coordinates, moving content.
 *
 * Called once per rendered frame (post-render, pre-swap) on the frame the
 * copy would read. The hash covers every visible cell of every covered row
 * (same visibility rules as getSelectedText: noSelect and spacer cells
 * skipped) via the cell's TEXT — `charPool.get(charId)` — not its pool
 * index, plus the two soft-wrap inputs that decide how those cells are laid
 * out into lines (the row's own `softWrap[row]`, and the `softWrap[row + 1]`
 * extractRowText reads as this row's content end). styleId is excluded so
 * the selection overlay and syntax highlighting themselves cannot trip the
 * guard.
 *
 * Why content and not charId: a charId is an index into a generational
 * CharPool, not a stable identity. Ink.resetPools() (ink.tsx) swaps in a
 * fresh CharPool every ~5 minutes and re-interns the front frame through
 * migrateScreenPools, so the SAME glyph comes back under a different
 * number. Hashing ids would read that renumbering as "the covered rows
 * changed" and refuse a perfectly legitimate copy with the stale-content
 * notice — a false positive on a screen where nothing was replaced. The
 * pool lookup is an array index plus a 1-2 code-unit hash loop, measured
 * at ~0.05ms for a full 200x50 selection (~0.14ms at 200x200), i.e. no
 * worse than hashing the ids themselves.
 *
 * The hash is only a PRE-FILTER; the verdict is the copied text. Hashing the
 * wrap inputs keeps a cheap screen-signature, but those inputs can move while
 * the bytes a copy would ship stay identical: flipping the next row's wrap bit
 * from 0 to a value past the selection's last column only toggles
 * trailing-blank trimming, which is invisible when the selected columns are
 * already full (measured live: a streaming tail wrote a row far below the
 * highlight, the wrap bookkeeping moved, and the guard refused a legitimate
 * copy — the "content under the selection changed" toast with the highlight
 * still sitting on exactly the right text). So when the hash moves, this
 * compares `getSelectedText` against the baselined text and latches only when
 * THE BYTES differ — the same expression the copy itself ships, which makes
 * the verdict complete (no real replacement is missed) and sound (no
 * unchanged text is refused). The text is compared, not stored per frame: the
 * extraction runs on a geometry change (once per drag motion) and on a
 * suspected change, never on the steady-state frame.
 *
 * @param s - the selection state to fingerprint.
 * @param screen - the frame's screen buffer.
 * @param coordinated - true when this frame translated the selection
 *   endpoints (follow-shift or viewport resize); a fingerprint change in
 *   such a frame is the expected content scroll, not an overwrite.
 * @returns true when an uncoordinated change latched `stale` this call.
